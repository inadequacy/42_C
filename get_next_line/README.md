# get_next_line

### Description

This project reads from fd and returns the first line, determined by wherever it finds '\n'.

### Instructions

By typing "make" in the terminal the project should compile. Lmao?

### Resources

The logic is pretty straight forward, getting it to handle text files that are just '\n' was insanely stupid and I hated it, liberaly gaslighted AI into helping me figure it out (it was'nt very helpful). Another problem was accidently Mallocing 0, which needed an edge case too. Annoying and glad to be done.

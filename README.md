# 42_C
Code written during my time at 42 Berlin. This all being in C.

<sarcasm>
I am among the batch of privileged students first being converted to the Python curriculum, so the folders here are effectively all the C I am mandated to do.

Interesting and fun language, many frustrations, but that frustration won't let me forget what I've learned.

## LIBft

We created a library from scratch for this assignment. The most challenging of these was, without a shadow of a doubt, ft_split. 

## Printf

Print Format. Classic. Didn't do any of the fancy extras.

## Get Next Line

Reads the next line from a file description, in so doing also remembers where it is in reading it. Is giving C energy, interesting challenge.

## Push Swap

A.K.A. my first sorting algorithm. I found this deeply unfun, _are you allowed to write that_? Ahaha. __Yeah__.

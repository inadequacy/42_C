### Description

Copy the behavior of the printf function. Basic requirements should cover cspdiuxX and %. 

### Instructions

Can be compiled like normal, no main or tests are included because I am bad at what I do. You welcome.

### Resources

Refered to the manual for printf's general behavior, Google and their friends helped me understand what va_arg is and how to use it. 

## Algorithm
I kinda thought let me make a thing that writes to terminal, then figure out how to handle the cases. In the end a lot of these cases overlap so I combined them, and some cases required a bit more code but overall not too complex. Tried to use as few functions as possible to keep it overviewable.

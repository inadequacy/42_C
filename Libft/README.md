# Libft

### Description

The project contains a modified version of the Libft library, made by hand by me. Additionally I created (as per the assignment) functions to handle lists.

### Instructions

By typing "make" in the terminal the project should compile.

### Resources

Google, peers, brute force attempts at fixing small logic mistakes, and figuring out what I am doing wrong. Used Tripouille tester online which can be found at this link: https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester.
